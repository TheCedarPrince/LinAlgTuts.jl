# Julia Linear Algebra Tutorials

This repository is a work in progress.

This repository contains tutorials that go alongside the textbook _Introduction to Linear Algebra_ by Gilbert Strang. [1] Additional materials may be included in these tutorials not found in the textbook. Where they occur, they will be properly cited and referenced in that corresponding notebook.

Each tutorial is contained in a Pluto notebook. To add Pluto to your Julia installation run the following:

```
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("Pluto.jl")

```

Clone this repository to your machine and enjoy the tutorials.

If there are any issues or inaccuracies, please let me know in the issues section.
